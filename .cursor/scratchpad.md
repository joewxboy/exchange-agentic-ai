# Organization and User AI Agent Implementation Plan

# Node Management Agent Enhancement Plan

## Background and Motivation
The NodeManagementAgent currently focuses on operational management tasks like monitoring and health checks, but lacks several important administrative capabilities that are available through the Exchange API. This enhancement plan aims to add these missing features to provide a more complete node management solution.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. **Integration Complexity**
   - Need to maintain consistency with existing agent patterns
   - Must handle errors and edge cases appropriately
   - Should preserve existing monitoring capabilities

2. **Security Considerations**
   - Node registration requires careful handling of credentials
   - Deletion operations need proper validation
   - Policy management needs proper access control

3. **Testing Requirements**
   - Need comprehensive test coverage for new functionality
   - Must test error handling and edge cases
   - Should include integration tests with Exchange API
