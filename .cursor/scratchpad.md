# Open Horizon Agentic AI Project

## Background and Motivation

This project aims to create a robust Python client library for interacting with the Open Horizon Exchange API. The library provides a secure, efficient, and user-friendly interface for managing services and nodes in an Open Horizon deployment.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

- **Authentication**: Secure handling of API credentials and session management.
- **URL Construction**: Ensuring correct API endpoint construction and handling of base URLs.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for API responses, network issues, and invalid data.
- **Session Management**: Efficient session handling to minimize API calls and improve performance.
- **Credential Management**: Secure storage and validation of API credentials.
- **Service Management**: Validation, creation, update, deletion, search, and version listing of services.
- **Node Management**: Registration, status monitoring, update, and deletion of nodes.

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
- Exchange API Client implementation is complete and working correctly
- Successfully tested with real API endpoint
- Next steps involve updating documentation and implementing service, pattern, and node management features

## Lessons
- Always read the file before editing
- Use proper error handling for API responses
- Handle JSON responses even for error status codes
- Ensure correct URL construction without redundant path components
- Use proper authentication header format for Basic Auth
- Test with real API endpoints to verify functionality

## Next Steps
1. Update README.md with comprehensive documentation
2. Begin implementation of Service Management features
3. Add comprehensive validation for service creation and updates
4. Implement service search and filtering capabilities
5. Add deployment configuration support
6. Create unit tests for new service management features

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
- Node management test script now lists nodes and uses the first node for all operations.
- Script safely skips node operations if no nodes are found in the organization.
- All previous enhancements and fixes have been applied and tested.

## Next Steps
1. Implement node creation/registration logic when the API supports it.
2. Improve error handling and reporting in test scripts and client code.
3. Expand integration tests to cover other resource types (services, patterns, etc.).
4. Gather user feedback to prioritize further improvements or new features.

## Planner's Note
- The project is ready for the next round of feature planning or review. Awaiting user direction on which area to prioritize next.
